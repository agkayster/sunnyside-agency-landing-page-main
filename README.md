## Overview
The summary of this project was to build a sunnyside agency landing page for both small devices and desktop views.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I kicked off my process with the mobile view because I knew it was going to be easy for me to add mediaqueries with the mobile view than starting with the desktop.

I took each step one after the other while using the mobile design. So I divided the following into <sections>:
a. Navbar and header image
b. Transform image and transform write-up
c. Stand-out image and stand-out write-up
d. Graphic design and Photography
e. Client testimonials
f. Images
g. Services and Logos

After I had finsihed the mobile view, I implemented a media-query using width 375 and then went in to build the desktop view.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Bulma (CSS framework)

### What I learned

My major learnings all came from using flexbox and re-enforcing that knowledge of flexbox.

Also I have never used such images before, I really feel that the images and the design pattern made this site very beautiful.
### Continued development

My continued development would focus more on implementing navbar-burger active using JavaScript, I know how to do that with React but I still need to learn how to implement navbar-burger with JavaScript.

### Useful resources

All the resources came from Frontend Masters and I really liked them.
